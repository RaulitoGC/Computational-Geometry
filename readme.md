Welcome to Computational Geometry!
================================

Computational geometry, as one can easily guess from the name, is the branch of computer science encompassing geometrical problems and how their solutions may be implemented (efficiently, one would hope) on a computer. (http://wcipeg.com/wiki/Computational_geometry#Definition)

#### How to tell whether a point is to the right or left side of a line

Remember that when we multiplicate two vectors, the result is another vector that's perpendicular to the others two vectors.

We need to know the sign of the vector, if the sign is positive then the point is to the right if the sign is negative then the point is to the left and finally if the sign is zero then the point belongs to the line.
