###**How to tell whether a point is to the right or left side of a line**

We need to know the sign of the vector, if the sign is positive then the point is to the right if the sign is negative then the point is to the left and finally if the sign is zero then the point belongs to the line.
 
We have tree points:
 - Point 'a' and point 'c' belongs to the line
 - Point 'b' don't belong to the line (we want to know the position of this point)

The first vector is A = a - b  = (a.x - b.x,a.y - b.y) and the second vector is B = c - b  = (c.x - b.x, c.y - b.y).

We multiply the two vectors AxB, but we are only interested the sign.


			
			|    i            j         k   |
	AxB	 =	| a.x - b.x   a.y - b.y     0   |
			| c.x - b.x   c.y - b.y     0   |

	sign(AxB)  = ((a.x - b.x) * (c.y - b.y))-((a.y - b.y) * (c.x - b.x))
