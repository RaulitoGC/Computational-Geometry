###**How to tell whether a point is to the right or left side of a line**

We need to know the sign of the vector, if the sign is positive then the point is to the right if the sign is negative then the point is to the left and finally if the sign is zero then the point belongs to the line.
 
We have tree points:
 - Point 'a' and point 'c' belongs to the line
 - Point 'b' don't belong to the line (we want to know the position of this point)

The first vector is A = a - b  = (a.x - b.x,a.y - b.y) and the second vector is B = c - b  = (c.x - b.x, c.y - b.y).

We multiply the two vectors AxB, but we are only interested the sign.


			
			|    i            j         k   |
	AxB	 =	| a.x - b.x   a.y - b.y     0   |
			| c.x - b.x   c.y - b.y     0   |

	sign(AxB)  = ((a.x - b.x) * (c.y - b.y))-((a.y - b.y) * (c.x - b.x))  

```
// A  program in C++ to find if a point is to the right or left of a line
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

// structure to represent a Point in 2D plane
struct point{
	double x;
	double y;
};

// A structure to represent a Straight-line in 2D plane
struct sLine{
	double x;
	double y;
	double m;
	double b;
};

//return function value y = mx + b
double f(sLine *sl){
	return  sl->y = sl->m*sl->x + sl->b;
}

// constant 'a' and 'b' different to zero
double condPoint(sLine *sl, point *b){
	point pa;
	point *a;
	a = &pa;
	//take one point with x = 1 
	a->x = sl->x = 1;
	a->y = f(sl);

	point pc;
	point *c;
	c = &pc;
	//take another point with x = -1
	c->x = sl->x = -1;
	c->y = f(sl);

	double position = ((a->x - b->x)*(c->y - b->y)) - ((c->x - b->x)*(a->y - b->y));
	return position;
}

int main(){

	//Create a straight line
	sLine l0;
	sLine *l;
	l = &l0;

	//read straight line
	cin>>l->m;
	cin>>l->b;

	//create a point
	point p0;
	point *p;
	p = &p0;

	//read point
	cin>>p->x;
	cin>>p->y;

	double position = condPoint(l,p);

	if(position ==0) printf("%s\n", "the point p belongs to the line" );
	else if(position > 0) printf("%s\n", "point p is on the right" );
		else printf("%s\n", "point p is on the left" );

	return 0;
}
```
